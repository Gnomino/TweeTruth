# TweeTruth

This simple app allows anyone to post things using your Twitter account, for a limited time.

It's useless. But I found it cool, and it is a pretty simple example for Twitter OAuth use. :-)


## Installation
Copy the files, register a twitter app and fill tokens in config.php

Also, change the date in Tweet.php (I let you figure how to yourself ;D)
